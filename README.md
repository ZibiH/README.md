# 👋 Hello, I'm Zbyszek Holak!
_...but you can call me Zibi 👌 (shorter and less difficult for some 🙊)_

**My goal is to become Web Developer**, but I have not decided yet what exactly I want to do in web development area 🤷‍♂️

**FRONTEND** - that's what I am learning now 📖  
**BACKEND** - looks pretty awesome IMHO 🧬  
**SECURITY** - I like to solve puzzles and look for holes 🔓  
_and there are so many different possibilities... blockchain, testing, DevOps etc. Haven't tried yet, but who knows 😏_

### Anyway - I feel pretty at ease with **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**, familiar with **TypeScript**, **Node** and tools like:
- VSC
- Git
- NPM
- Webpack
- Babel
- Parcel
- ESLint
- Chrome DevTools  
---  
#### Tech's and tools to learn in the near future:
- React and Redux
- Next.js
- Express.js
- PHP (maybe 😏)
- PWA
- Webstorm
- Figma

### Cheers! 👨‍🦲 🤝
