# 👋 Hello, I'm Zbigniew Holak!
_...but you can call me Zibi 👌 (shorter and less difficult for some 🙊)_

###My goal is to become Web Developer
I have not decided yet what exactly I want to do in web development area 🤷‍♂️
---
**Frontend** - that's what I learn now 📖
**Backend** - looks pretty awesome IMHO 🧬
**Security** - I like to solve puzzles and look for a holes 🔓
---

And there is so many other options... blockchain, testing, DevOps etc. Haven't tried yet, but who knows 😏

##Anyways - I feel pretty ok with **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**, familiar with **TypeScript**, **Node** and tools like:
- VSC
- Git
- NPM
- Webpack
- Babel
- Parcel
- ESLint
- Chrome DevTools

---

##Tech's and tools to learn in near future:
- React
- Redux
- Next.js
- Express.js
- GraphQL
- Vue 
- PHP (maybe 😏)
- JS libraries (i.e. lodash, axios, gsap, three.js)
- PWA
- Webstorm
- Figma

###Cheers! 👨‍🦲 🤝
