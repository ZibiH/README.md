# 👋 Hello, I am Zbyszek!

**My goal is to become Web Developer**, but I have not decided yet what exactly I want to do in web development area 🤷‍♂️

**FRONTEND** - that's what I am learning now 📖  
**BACKEND** - looks pretty awesome IMHO 🧬  
**SECURITY** - I like to solve puzzles and look for holes 🔓  
_and there is so many different possibilities..._

### Anyway - I feel pretty at ease with **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**, familiar with **TypeScript**, **Angular**, **React**, **Node**, **Express** and tools like:
- VSC
- Git
- NPM
- ESLint
- Chrome DevTools  
- Angular Material
- SCSS
---  
#### Tech's and tools to learn in the near future:
- enhancing the knowledge of Angular (NgRx, unit testing) and React 
- Next.js
- AWS
- Figma

### Cheers! 👨‍🦲 🤝
