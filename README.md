# 👋 Hello, I am Zbyszek!

**My goal is to become Web Developer**, but I have not decided yet what exactly I want to do in web development area 🤷‍♂️

**FRONTEND** - that's what I am learning now 📖  
**BACKEND** - looks pretty awesome IMHO 🧬  
**SECURITY** - I like to solve puzzles and look for holes 🔓  
_and there is so many different possibilities..._

### Anyway - I feel pretty at ease with: 
- **HTML** 
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript**
- **React**
---  

familiar with:

- **TypeScript** 
- **Angular**  
- **Node** 
- **Express** 
- **Next JS
- **TailwindCSS**
---  

and tools like:

- VSC
- Git
- NPM
- ESLint
- Chrome DevTools  
- Angular Material
---  

### Cheers! 👨‍🦲 🤝
